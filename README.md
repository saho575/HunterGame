### ðŸŽ® **Hunters â€“ A Mini Game of Strategic Escape**

**Hunters** is a short yet intellectually engaging mini game consisting of three levels. Players navigate a map filled with randomly placed obstacles, collecting all the gold while avoiding the pursuing Hunters. The goal is to gather all the gold without being caught and then escape through a hidden exit that opens afterward.

In each level, the placement of gold and walls changes, adding replayability and surprise elements. As players advance, the levels become more difficult and the map more complex.

**Hunters** is not just a fun escape game â€” it also serves as a technical demonstration of advanced AI algorithms like **Minimax** and **A\***. These algorithms shape both enemy behavior and the player's strategic movements.
